## 1. What is typhoid feaver 
Salmonella enterica is the bacterium that causes the potentially fatal disease typhoid fever. It is highly contagious. 
A person who is infected can expel the bacteria from their body through their stools or, sometimes, through their urine. 
Typhoid fever is most prevalent in regions of the world with poor sanitation and insufficient access to clean water. 
Children have a high chance of getting affected by Typhoid fever because of their low immunity. However, compared to adults, children with typhoid fever typically 
exhibit milder symptoms.

### The areas with the highest rates of typhoid fever are:

- The Indian subcontinent
- Africa
- south and southeast Asia
- South America

About 121,000 - 161,000 people die due to Typhoid fever and around 11-20 million people get infected by Salmonella per year.

## 2. How it is spread
- Using a contaminated toilet and touching your mouth before washing your hands. (Through fecal-oral route )
- Consuming food or water infected with Salmonella typhi (S. Typhi)
- Consuming seafood that has been exposed to polluted stools or urine.
- Engaging in oral or anal sex with someone who is a Salmonella typhi carrier.

## 3. Common symptoms 
- Persistent high temperature that gradually increases each day
- Headache
- General aches and pains
- Extreme tiredness (fatigue)
- Cough
- Constipation

As the infection progresses, you may lose your appetite, feel sick, and have a tummy ache and diarrhoea. Some people may develop a rash.
Symptoms may differ and increase when it goes to the higher stages of the illness.

### Symptoms of the 4 stages of typhoid fever
#### Stage 1
 - Dry cough
- Indolence 
- Headache 
- May or may not be accompanied with fever.

#### Stage 2
- High fever 
- Bloated stomach 
- Weight loss 
- Feel lethargic 

#### Stage 3
- Abdominal haemorrhage
- Difficulty in sitting up, let alone standing or walking.
- Inflammation of the brain
- Dehydration
#### Stage 4
- Extremely high fever. 
- Severe infections
- Kidney failure
- Pneumonia
- Inflammation of the pancreas or Meningitis.

## 5. Precautions
- Proper hygiene specially when handling food and water 
- Maintain good hygiene and sanitation when using toilets 
- Get vaccinated 

## 6. How is typhoid treated?
- Antibiotics must be taken as soon as possible to cure typhoid fever.
    - Early diagnosis of typhoid fever increases the chance that the infection will be mild and that it will be treatable at home with a 7â€“14-day course of 
    antibiotic pills.
- Feed well
- Drink enough fluids

## 7. Vaccine 
There are 2 vaccinations that can provide some defense against typhoid illness. These may require taking three capsules on alternate days or receiving a single injection.
Although neither vaccine provides 100 percent protection.

## 8. What tests can be done to diagnose typhoid fever?
- Blood test
- Stool or urine test
- Bone marrow (rare method)
- X-rays (to examine the changes in lungs)

WARNING: Up to 1 in 5 typhoid fever patients are estimated to die if they are not treated. Some of those who survive will have complications caused by the infection.
