# Links to my contributions/Pull Requests.

Hello Everyone. Nice to meet you.<br>
My name is Agien Petra. A Bachelor of Technology in Software Engineering holder, from the College of TEchnology at the University of Bamenda, Cameroon.

My interest in Telemedicine has been my drive towards contributing at Mboalab organization, as this organization is a combo of tech and medicine (my two favorite fields).<br>
I like to call myself a tech evangelist. My interests include project management, technical writing, social media management, and data analysis.<br> 
I have had the opportunity to practice these skills in personal and group projects, witht the most recent at the GDSC University of Bamenda, where i served as the marketing/social media lead.<br>
I have had experience in flutter mobile App developement using Dart, and I am ready to implement that.

I am going to implement these skills such as writing articles for the website(blog), marketing the organization/projects especially on social media.<br>
Designing graphic related aspects at the organization, and also input my project managemnet skills in these projects.
