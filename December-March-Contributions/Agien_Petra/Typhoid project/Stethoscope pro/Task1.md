# Task 1: Designing a Logo for the Project
## Introduction.
Pulse rate can be used in telemedicine to check heart disease, some infections, potassium levels in the blood, or thyroid.  
This application is to enable users take pulse rate technologically, keeping in mind its affordable yet effective feature.
After carefully going through the Stethoscope repository, and using [Sthestapp](https://www.hackster.io/mixpose/digital-stethoscope-ai-1e0229) as a guide, I propose the following logo: [click here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZMaIH_GRyx1ZEmlMAKi2x1EX9ti4gpnu?usp=sharing)
